;; 
;; This program implements an interpreter for the esoteric programming
;; language "A Queue which can't grow", invented by the Esolang user
;; "ChuckEsoteric08" and presented on May 27th, 2023, its diorism's
;; manifestation an integer-valued queue of fixed cardinality,
;; initialized once via user inputs, and operated upon by a perpetually
;; cycling loop which never persistently modulates its memory's size
;; during its modifications.
;; 
;; 
;; Concept
;; =======
;; The "A Queue which can't grow" programming language is defined by
;; a memory composed of a single queue, initialized in an incipient
;; stage by user input numbers, and operated upon in a perpetual loop by
;; commands which modify the content, yet ultimately retain the
;; user-specified size.
;; 
;; == PROGRAM: INITIALIZE ONCE, REPEAT ALWAYS ==
;; Every "A Queue which can't grow" program inchoates with its memory
;; queue's initially vacant population by a series of
;; semicolon-separated integer numbers committed via the standard input,
;; ere its infinite loop, involving the command executions, commences.
;; 
;; The entirety of this process shall be listed alow:
;; 
;;   (1) INITIALIZATION
;;       The user is queried via the standard input conduit for a
;;       sequence of zero or more signed integer numbers, each twain
;;       segregated by exactly one semicolon, thus conformant with the
;;       format
;;         number_1 ; number_2 ; ... ; number_i ; ... ; number_N
;;       These items are subsequently enqueued, in their specification
;;       order, into the initially empty memory queue.
;;   
;;   (2) OPERATION CYCLE
;;       The program enters a perpetual iteration, executing the stated
;;       instructions once for every cycle.
;; 
;; == THE QUEUE: THE CENTRAL STORAGE ENTITY ==
;; A queue of signed integer numbers constitutes the singular storage
;; implement, the cardinality of which, succeeding its initialization by
;; user inputs, never veridically changes.
;; 
;; 
;; Architecture
;; ============
;; The euonym that constitutes the language's agnomination,
;; "A Queue which can't grow", abstains from any deceptions, as its
;; aefauld memory representative is realized in a queue of signed
;; integer numbers, initialized at a program's inchoation by user
;; provisions, and only altered in its content, never persistently in
;; its size.
;; 
;; 
;; Data Types
;; ==========
;; A paregal in its homogeneity to the architecture, the language's type
;; system recognized a single specimen only: signed integers of any
;; magnitude, their castaldy consigned to the eponymous queue's wike.
;; 
;; 
;; Syntax
;; ======
;; The "A Queue which can't grow" programming language, regarding a
;; conspectuity upon its syntaxis, occurs as a composition of zero or
;; more single-character commands, optionally formatted via whitespaces,
;; but not admissive to any other content.
;; 
;; == INSTRUCTIONS ==
;; A treble of instructions exist, each represented by a single
;; character, and destitute of a parameter's requisitum.
;; 
;; Any other content, besides the command identifiers and whitespaces,
;; is inflicted with interdiction and will instigate an error upon an
;; encounter.
;; 
;; == WHITESPACES ==
;; Whitespaces, a term whose perimeter embraces spaces, horizontal tabs,
;; and newlines, are subject to a homologation at any location and in
;; every mete reckoned appropriate to the programmer's own requisites.
;; 
;; == COMMENTS ==
;; No provision for comments wones in the current language rendition.
;; 
;; == GRAMMAR ==
;; An Extended Backus-Naur Form (ENBF) description shall embue the
;; syntactical treatise with enhanced formality:
;; 
;;   program         := { whitespace | command } ;
;;   command         := increment | decrementOrJump | return;
;;   increment       := "|" ;
;;   decrementOrJump := "/" ;
;;   return          := "\" ;
;;   whitespace      := " " | "\t" | "\n" ;
;; 
;; 
;; Instructions
;; ============
;; A kenspeckle niggardliness wones in the language's operational
;; compartment, its competences intrined by an aefauld incrementation
;; instruction, a conditional decrementation/jump facility, and the
;; latter's twissel for referencing during the control flow incitement.
;; 
;; == OVERVIEW ==
;; The following apercu shall impart a foundational mete of gnarity
;; concerning the language's operational facilities:
;; 
;;   ------------------------------------------------------------------
;;   Command | Effect
;;   --------+---------------------------------------------------------
;;   |       | Dequeues the first queue element, increments it by one,
;;           | and enqueues the result.
;;           |---------------------------------------------------------
;;           | An error of the type "EmptyQueueError" is signaled if
;;           | the queue is empty at the time of this operation's
;;           | invocation.
;;   ..................................................................
;;   /       | Dequeues an element, and proceeds in one of the
;;           | following modes:
;;           |   - If the dequeued element does not equal zero (0),
;;           |     decrements it by one, and enqueues the result.
;;           |   - If the dequeued element equals zero (0), enqueues
;;           |     the value zero (0, and moves the instruction pointer
;;           |     (IP) forward to the position of the matching "\"
;;           |     command.
;;           |---------------------------------------------------------
;;           | An error of the type "EmptyQueueError" is signaled if
;;           | the queue is empty at the time of this operation's
;;           | invocation.
;;   ..................................................................
;;   \       | Defines a jump destination for the preceding "/"
;;           | command, while itself accompassing no causatum.
;;   ------------------------------------------------------------------
;; 
;; 
;; Lacunae in the Specification
;; ============================
;; The curtailed nature appertaining to the language's original
;; specifications inflicts the same with a certain set of ambiguities,
;; a subset of which shall be the following treatise's cynosure.
;; 
;; == ARE BALANCED JUMP POINTS MANDATED? ==
;; The twifaced causata commorant in the "/" command, namely, its
;; deduction or conditional goto mechanism, are embued with a
;; contingency --- but not a requisitum --- to rely on a matching "\"
;; token for its destination's referral. It is, however, not expressed
;; whether such a "/" and "\" twissen perforce ought to occur in
;; conjunction.
;; 
;; It has been adjudged to not impose a mandate upon a balanced vinculum
;; betwixt "/" and "\" commands, involving the homologation of either
;; species to participate with an independent encheson. This conjecture
;; founds upon two instances of ideation:
;; 
;;   (1) The jump destination command "\" is expressed in the protolog
;;       as a NOP (no-operation), and thus only utible in relation with
;;       a "/" counterpart.
;;   (2) The "/" may not conclude in a jump effect at all, rendering an
;;       imperative arbitrary and unvindicated.
;; 
;; == ARE NEGATIVE INTEGER VALUES HOMOLOGATED? ==
;; During its operative phase, "A Queue which can't grow"'s dioristic
;; instruction set effectively obviates the assumption of negative
;; integer values by the distinguishing manner of its deduction command
;; "/", the same only reduces the queue's foremost member if and only if
;; the same does not equal zero. For strictly non-negative integer
;; elements, this behavior ascertains no descent below this threshold;
;; if, on the other hand, the inchoate user provision of elements
;; incorporates negative specifications, the queue will be confronted
;; with such a use case.
;; 
;; It has been adjudged to homologate negative user input numbers,
;; encumbering the provider with the onus of a program's continued
;; sanity.
;; 
;; 
;; Implementation
;; ==============
;; This interpreter has been implemented in the programming language
;; Common Lisp.
