;; 
;; This program implements an interpreter for the esoteric programming
;; language "DerpScrp", invented by the Esolang user "A" and presented
;; on July 3rd, 2019, the commorancy of its diorism is located in a
;; derivation from "DerpText" by the Esolang user "Fuckerturd", with a
;; concomitant curtailment in the complexity, while yet retaining the
;; self-modifying program capacity of the source code, maintained by a
;; dedicated variable among the infinite tally's standard treble.
;; 
;; 
;; Concept
;; =======
;; The DerpScrp programming language subsumes into the species of that
;; esoteric programming language whose potential for self-modification
;; homologates the program's dynamic modulation during the execution
;; phase; in this particular case registering its entelechy in a member
;; of the standard variables' gleek, nevened as "C", in the compernage
;; of its twain "A" and "B", as well as the contingency for an infinite
;; tally of siclike string-valued succedanea defined by the programmer.
;; 
;; == DERPSCRP PROGRAM'S HOMOLOGATE THEIR MODIFICATION ==
;; Begotten by a derivation from the language DerpText, DerpScrp
;; appropriates the kenspeckle proprium of the warklume's accoutrement
;; for the source code's immediate modulation.
;; 
;; This faculty's firmament emerges from the provenance of its conjoined
;; data and code principles as adjustable strings. The program,
;; alligated into a consanguinity with the console and text variables,
;; participates in an overt access of its content for perquisitions and
;; alterations, the latter species of adit engenders the dynamic
;; conduction of the runtime deportment.
;; 
;; == EXECUTION: COMMAND DETECTION, EXTRACTION, EVALUATION, ITERANCE ==
;; A DerpScrp program's execution complies with the following ordered
;; tesseratomy:
;; 
;;   (1) COMMAND DETECTION:
;;       Proceeding from the start position into the command string,
;;       curated under the castaldy of the variable "C", the leading
;;       operation's detection and selection, in the intent's pursuit
;;       of a subsequent execution, is performed.
;;   
;;   (2) COMMAND EXCISION:
;;       The just delineated command tmema is subjected to an excision
;;       from the program string's front; as a consectary and a
;;       concomitant, during the command's following execution, the
;;       prevenient state escapes the apprehension in favor of the
;;       newly curtailed one. This modification, of course, applies to
;;       the value of the "C" variable in an epiphenomenal fashion.
;;   
;;   (3) COMMAND EXECUTION:
;;       The selected command's execution is actuated; this procession
;;       cannot rely on the already excised command's own code portion.
;;   
;;   (4) REPETITION:
;;       If no vacancy inflicts the program string, stored in the
;;       command variable "C", the process perpetuates its iterance by
;;       a recurrence in the step -> (1); otherwise, for a now empty
;;       source code, the cycle's termination conflates with a cessation
;;       in the program.
;; 
;; == VARIABLES MAP IDENTIFIERS TO STRINGS ==
;; The paravaunt mode of data castaldy is apportioned to the variable
;; registry's bailiwick, where an arbitrary accompt of placeholders,
;; in addition to the autochthonous triple of "A", "B", and "C",
;; partakes of the salvatories' accommodation for string objects.
;; 
;; == VARIABLE NAMES COMPREHEND ZERO OR MORE CHARACTERS ==
;; A variable's agnomination lays its amplection around zero or more
;; characters as the identifying component, with a homologation that
;; generally wists of no impositions in the haecceity; however, no
;; variable name's conformation may tolerate the inclusion of symbols
;; necessitated for a command's assemblage.
;; 
;; For instance, the value exchange/assignment command
;; 
;;   =leftArgument=rightArgument=
;; 
;; eschews the incorporation of the equality sign "=" in any of its
;; argument jumelles "leftArgument" and "rightArgument", forecause an
;; infliction with ambivalency emerges from siccan combination.
;; 
;; == INTRINSIC VARIABLES ==
;; The compass of autochthonous succedanea is restricted to a pair
;; royal in membership, and shall be a cursory ilk of elucidation's
;; cynosure:
;; 
;;   ------------------------------------------------------------------
;;   Variable | Internal name  | Role
;;   ---------+----------------+---------------------------------------
;;   A        | output string  | Represents the console content.
;;            |                | This text is printed perpetually, with
;;            |                | a prerogation of 0.5 seconds betwixt
;;            |                | any two cycles, ere the screen's
;;            |                | clearance.
;;            |                |---------------------------------------
;;            |                | It is homologated to be empty.
;;   ..................................................................
;;   B        | text string    | Is initialized by the user in a step
;;            |                | prevenient to the program's
;;            |                | inchoation.
;;            |                |---------------------------------------
;;            |                | It is homologated to remain empty.
;;   ..................................................................
;;   C        | command string | Contains the program source code.
;;            |                | During their processing, the commands
;;            |                | are being deleted from this string's
;;            |                | beginning.
;;   ------------------------------------------------------------------
;; 
;; == DISTINGUISHMENT BETWIXT VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS ==
;; In the face of the syntactical carency concerning a merist's
;; assignment to the construe of variables in counterdistinguishment
;; from constants, the nomothesia's imposition holds that any identifier
;; lacking a registration as a variable name by default attains a
;; literal's role.
;; 
;; Such a succedaneum binding's establishment ensues from the
;; contingency of the exchange/assignment behest
;; 
;;   =leftArgument=rightArgument=
;; 
;; where the sinistral "leftArgument" may, if not already defined in
;; this term, enjoy the "rightArgument" content's reception.
;; 
;; == CONSOLE OUTPUT UPDATES IN CYCLES OF HALF-SECONDS ==
;; DerpScrp's output visualization entertains a gendrure from the
;; champarty of the executing environment's textual console and the
;; output variable "A", governed in this aspect by a lealty to the
;; following principle:
;; 
;;   (1) The console content, stored in the variable "A", is issued to
;;       the console's output conduit.
;;   
;;   (2) The display remains unaltered for 0.5 seconds.
;;   
;;   (3) As the delay's sequela, the console is cleared, seguing into
;;       an iterum application of the first step -> (1).
;; 
;; 
;; Instructions
;; ============
;; A mere quintuple contingency accomplishes the instruction set's
;; exhaustion, a few specimens among this membership entalented with a
;; variation on the deportment as an ultimity of the concrete arguments'
;; nature.
;; 
;; == OVERVIEW ==
;; The following apercu's dation shall contribute the necessary nortelry
;; concerning the language's operative avails.

;; Implementation
;; ==============
;; The project at hand has been implemented in the programming language
;; Common Lisp, its operative causata's adhibition a sequela from the
;; immediate DerpScrp source code's consumption, whence the most
;; recently detected instruction's reformulation as a dedicated object
;; furnishes a parasceve to its operative causata's adhibition.
;; 
;; The most peisant contribution, however, to whom a commorancy inwith
;; this project serves a vouchsafement is nevened in the "META" parser's
;; participation, a compound endowed with both bailiwicks of a lexical
;; analyzer (lexer), as a necessary parergon, and, in a paravaunt
;; agency, a recursive-descent parser, their reification's gendrure
;; ensues from the requisite Common Lisp source code's assemblage via
;; macros, rather than the coefficiency accoutred by immediate
;; functions.
;; 
;; For the treatise dedicated to this technique's elucidation, please
;; exercise your conspectuity on the section alow, endowed with the
;; euonym "META", as well as, partially and ordained in the wike of
;; supererogation, in the consequent "Appendices".
;; 
;; 
;; META
;; ====
;; META represents a technique airted at a recursive descent parser's
;; assemblage, its distinguishment's proprium that of the requisite
;; code's generation via a series of macros, aided in this endeavor by
;; dedicated "META" expression encapsulation structures, concluding in
;; the thus constructed behests' application onto the optated Common
;; Lisp object --- most commonly, but not necessarily, a source string.
;; 
;; == THIS TREATISE'S CONSTITUTION ==
;; The treatise in its entirety may receive an entreparting into the
;; following logical compartments, whose enumeration conflates exactly
;; with the consequent sections' ordonnance:
;; 
;;   (1) What are META's goals?
;;       The purpose vindicating the META technique's gendrure will
;;       receive its condeign elucidations.
;;   
;;   (2) How does a typical META invocation appear?
;;       An exemplary code tmema, intended as a forbisen for a META
;;       parser utilization, demonstrates the foundational design.
;;   
;;   (3) What constitutes META's unique diorism?
;;       The propria edifying the provenance of META's discrepancy from
;;       common parsers will be enumerated.
;;   
;;   (4) How does META achieve its objectives?
;;       With the objective of compendiousness, the commodities
;;       appurtenancing META with the appuis for its onuses'
;;       satisfaction will be bewrayed, including in particular two
;;       species of macros. The thus begotten inchoate gnarity shall
;;       administer a parasceve to the later sections, with special
;;       regard the points -> (7) and -> (8), inwith those bailiwick
;;       are immersed the concrete implementation details.
;;   
;;   (5) How does META compare to regular expressions?
;;       Those aspects that serve in the alligation betwixt META and
;;       widespread regular expressions, as well as such acting in the
;;       agency of the twissel's merists, shall be reproduced.
;;   
;;   (6) Which META language constructs are defined and how do they
;;       correspond to Common Lisp?
;;       The object-oriented design to whom the reification of META's
;;       theoretical potentials to actual entelechia is assigned, with
;;       a special cynosure on the representative classes, enjoy their
;;       woning in this locality. A fortiori, the feelefold META
;;       constructs and their generalized expressions are mapped to
;;       tangible classes.
;;   
;;   (7) What code fragments do the META constructs generate?
;;       The champarty in which functions, macros, and classes announce
;;       their engagement with the purpose of the parser code's
;;       assemblage express their statements in this parcel. The thus
;;       established dispansion, however, does not yet encompass the
;;       kenspeckle regular-expression-like syntaxis commorant in META;
;;       the accommodation for this aspect shall be the succeeding
;;       point -> (8).
;;   
;;   (8) How do reader macros form the regular-expression-like syntax?
;;       The definitions of reader macros thilk install a bespoke
;;       syntax, in its designment and syntomy an aspirant of regular
;;       expressions, are capacitated for their extraction.
;; 
;; == A PROEM CONCERNING THE IMPLEMENTATION'S DIORISMS ==
;; This treatise shall not be encumbered with the wite of lapsing in
;; certain peisant aspects' rubrication, inwith whose perimeter
;; deviations and extensions of the original META principle germinate:
;; 
;;   (1) REDUCTION TO STRINGS
;;       Maugre the versality whose inherence in META redes the same
;;       meritous of plaudit, a compass not curtailed of lists and
;;       other forms as a compernage to the traditional string
;;       processing, this treatise's cynosure, as a consilience with the
;;       project's implementation, constricts itself to the latter
;;       subject only, scilicet, character sequences as the parsing
;;       effort's material.
;;   
;;   (2) RAMOSITY IN THE META OBJECT HIERARCHY
;;       A META expression's physical manifestation in Baker's
;;       implementation [baker1991prag] emerges in a single structure
;;       class' guise, employing as the requisite form's enscapsulation
;;       a field of a generic type, and for the discriminating criterion
;;       in the behavior's selection a sentinel character.
;;       
;;       The implementation deployed in this project, on the other hand,
;;       attends to a ramosity endowed with an elevated intricacy, by
;;       establishment of a dedicated class for each member of the
;;       quintuple META constructs. Two ultimities' emergences may be
;;       attested in this approach; imprimis, each ensconcing class
;;       bears the contingency for its specific form's concrete
;;       delineation, in the tally and types appertaining to such. As an
;;       example adduced, the META sequence and alternative constructs
;;       expect a list enumerating zero or more forms; a type test's
;;       reliance registers a twissel; while repetition and evaluation
;;       do not mandate an accompt aboon an aefauld membership.
;;       
;;       A second behoovable chevisance parlays of the capacity for
;;       dispatchments on the discrepant classes as succedanea to the
;;       original choice's case switch by the affiliated character slot.
;;   
;;   (3) DISCREPANCY IN THE INTERFACE
;;       A twain of deviations in conjunction with the nominal and
;;       interface subjects serve as kenspeckle merists from the
;;       provenance's design.
;;       
;;       Anent the agnomination's choice, a preponderance among the
;;       functions' and macros' monikers experiences a reformulation,
;;       in their caract both latreutical as the fulfilled wikes'
;;       more lucid significations, and, an overthwart to a bote, a
;;       fount to an enhaused nimiety's incursion. As a forbisen, the
;;       entry point, the macro "matchit", transforms through a change
;;       in its stevening to "match-expression".
;;       
;;       In the pertinence of its structural digression from the source,
;;       this implementation assigns as a concomitant to every macro a
;;       function whose notion realizes the underlying operative
;;       principles' furnishment; for instance, the original "matchit"
;;       macro, founded upon a type switch, in this design distributes
;;       across the implementations of the generic function
;;       "compile-expression", covering the selfsame variety of
;;       character, string, and META expression species.
;; 
;; == META'S TELOS: A PARSER OSTENDING A COMPENDIOUS SYNTAX ==
;; The telos comprising META's encheson of pursuit appertains to a
;; scannerless parser, one whose lexical analyzer (lexer) establishes
;; an item of the conjoined haecceity, the efforts of which capacitate
;; the same with its wikes' attendance, while a compendiousness limining
;; an approximation to the regular expressions' acquaintance designs a
;; paravaunt obbligato.
;; 
;; In an eath diction's conveyance, the META concept allows a parser
;; to be constructed utilizing a syntax desumed from regular
;; expressions, however, inserted directly into the surrounding Common
;; Lisp program, rather than communicated as a string of directives.
;; 
;; == META'S DESIGN: AN EXAMPLE ==
;; The alow forbisen shall furnish an endeictic vallidom to the META's
;; traditional bailiwicks. A simplistic demonstration, this parser
;; accepts a single digit, either unsigned or preceded by a plus "+" or
;; minus "-" symbol.
;; 
;; The first code tmema ostends the invocation of "match-expression" in
;; a form maintaining fealty to its pursued syntomy:
;; 
;;   (let ((sign              +1)
;;         (current-character NIL))
;;     (declare (type (member +1 -1)      sign))
;;     (declare (type (or null character) current-character))
;;     
;;     ;; Match a single signed or unsigned digit.
;;     (match-expression
;;       [ { #\+ [#\-! (setf sign -1)] !T }

;; == META'S DIORISMS: PROPRIA DIVERGING FROM TRADITIONAL PARSERS ==
;; A set comprehending several diorisms appertains to this species of
;; solution:
;; 
;;   (1) META ASSEMBLES THE PARSER CODE VIA MACROS:
;;       META proceeds by the recursive descent parser code's
;;       assemblage, ere thilk's adhibition, rather than the
;;       necessitated functions' definitions and invocations, as would
;;       be a common solution's approach.
;;       
;;       This entelechy stems from the Common Lisp macro concept's
;;       potentials, acting in an agency cognate to source code
;;       "templates", these, at the intended instant's execution,
;;       actuate their efficacy, employing the succedaneous sections
;;       as dynamically reacting constituents.
;;       
;;       Macros, expressed in lucid verbs, build Common Lisp code,
;;       while functions present, as in any other programming language,
;;       a computed result.
;;   
;;   (2) META PROVIDES A REGULAR-EXPRESSION-LIKE SYNTAX:
;;       The product's syntomy as an express bourne partaking of this
;;       concept's haecceity experiences its communication via a
;;       particular species of macros: the reader macros.
;;       
;;       As a divergent faculty, these constructs in their potentiation
;;       achieve a bespoke language's immediate insertion into the
;;       circumambient code, rather than as an advenient and, in its
;;       design, forinsecal string object. As a corollary, the mimicry
;;       of regular expressions becomes part of the Common Lisp syntax
;;       itself.
;;   
;;   (3) META'S CONCEPTS EXTEND TO ANY SPECIES OF SOURCE:
;;       As counterdistinguished from the traditional aspect of a
;;       parser's provenance, META's potency does not thole a
;;       constriction to strings as the sole subject of a parsing
;;       effort: The abstract nature of this technique homologates an
;;       extension across any Common Lisp form recluded to the
;;       implementor's apprehension.
;;       
;;       This allowance encompasses, without the claim of exhaustion,
;;       lists and numeric objects. The versatility embodied in this
;;       Procrustean mode of application enables, for instance, the
;;       parsing of Common Lisp argument lists themselves via a
;;       dedicated META parser implementation.
;;       
;;       The elevated capacitation's commorancy emerges from the META
;;       parser's coefficient engagement with reader macros, the same
;;       permit the substitution of the Common Lisp reader for a bespoke
;;       lexical analyzer and parser solution. In some sense, a reader
;;       macro halts the infrastructure apportioned the responsibility
;;       of the Lisp source code's consumption and interpretation and
;;       consigns this onus to the programmer's own castaldy. The code
;;       tmema produced by the developer-supplied reader macro callback
;;       function is subsequently invoked as if having naturally been
;;       part of the overall program.
;; 
;; == META'S WARKLUMES: MACROS THAT ASSEMBLE AND CURTAIL CODE ==
;; A twifold agency befalls the available Common Lisp macro variants'
;; competences and dispands its necessitation across an equinumerant
;; membership from thilk; scilicet, imprimis, general macros for the
;; recursive descent parser code's assemblage on one hand, and reader
;; macros for the bespoke regular-expression-like syntaxis' provision
;; on the other.
;; 
;; More details in an exposition shall be furnished by this epexegetical
;; listing:
;; 
;;   (1) GENERAL MACROS ASSEMBLE THE PARSER CODE:
;;       General macros are ordained to the recursive descent parser
;;       code's assemblage, the same ultimately produces an interplay of
;;       source string element accesses, character equality tests, type
;;       comparisons, logical combinations involving "and" as well as
;;       "or", and iterances.
;;       
;;       Maintaining fealty with the highest mete of comprehensiveness'
;;       tenability, macros define substitutions by replacing one form
;;       by an arbitrary account of other forms. Pursuing the covergence
;;       with our particular case, expressed via the "defmacro"
;;       facility, a macro limns a tantamount of a function that does
;;       not evaluate its arguments and which assembles and returns a
;;       program, contingently enriched with succedaneous fragments,
;;       which subsequently is executed.
;;       
;;       In an eather diction, while a function yields a resulting
;;       value, a macro produces a program that, after its execution,
;;       yields a resulting value.
;;       
;;       META's deployment of macros aspires the production of a
;;       parser's requisite instruction sequence by the assemblage of
;;       several code tmemata, each a dedicated macro's contribution.
;;   
;;   (2) READER MACROS PROVIDE A REGULAR-EXPRESSION-LIKE SYNTAX:
;;       Reader macros act in an opiferous modus as the warklumes for
;;       the syntactical syntomy's accomplishment, thilk encompasses
;;       the mimicry of regular expressions.
;;       
;;       Counterdistinguished from the preponderantly dispensed
;;       consuetude of such expressions' conveyance in a string form,
;;       the reader macro capacitates the Common Lisp syntaxis'
;;       veridicous modulation, whence ensues the possibility to insert
;;       META's variation of this "regular expression" immediately into
;;       the code in the circumambiency, vanquishing the discrepancy
;;       betwixt the language's autochthonous and META's adscititious
;;       provisions.
;; 
;; == A PROEM: META'S SYNTAXIS AND COMPETENCES ==
;; A inchoation of gnarity's conveyance concerning META's syntax and
;; competences shall be the following tabular interlude; their
;; spatial allocation in particular vindicated as a parasceuastic
;; accoutrement prevenient to the juxtaposition with the regular
;; expression design.
;; 
;; Please heed that succedaneous content is demarcated by a catena of
;; asterisks ("*") limning an underline.

;; == EACH META EXPRESSION IS MOLDED INTO A COMMON LISP CLASS ==

;; concepts, chosen in this treatise inwith the terminology of
;; "META expressions". Perambulating in the athwart direction, a diction
;; compernage to the highest echelon of reification, the Common Lisp
;; implementation itself, parlays of the manifesting "META classes".
;; 
;; The vincula betwixt the META *constructs*, whose deployment in the

;; == META'S OPERATIONS: THREE FUNCTIONS AND THREE MACROS ==
;; A sextuple contingent for operative warklumes, its partage that of
;; antilibration into a treble moeity of functions and an equinumerant
;; accompt of macros, the latter actually only invoke the former,
;; exhausts the META parser's foundational interface.
;; 
;; The six definitions shall be adduced alow:
;; 
;; compile-expression (expression : character)
;; compile-expression (expression : string)
;; compile-expression (expression : META-Object)
;;   A function which generates the Common Lisp code for testing the
;;   current input source character, or a sequence of character
;;   commencing at the current position into the source, against a
;;   desired character or string; or which, in the case of a
;;   META-OBJECT, probes its compliance with the source content
;;   starting at the current position.
;;   
;;   Upon a match's confirmation, this code accompasses the epiphenomena
;;   defined in the actuated macros "match-content" or "match-type", or
;;   any causata produced by the META-Object's inner workings, which
;;   might, as a concomitant to the prevenient twain, involve the
;;   "compile-expression" function's recursive invocation. In any case,
;;   the thus produced code fragment returns a generalized boolean
;;   value of "true".
;;   
;;   If no success could be attested, the code tmema incorporates the
;;   presentation of a generalized boolean value of "false".
;;   
;;   This function is utilized by the higher-level "match-expression"
;;   macro, which please see.
;; 
;; match-expression (expression)
;;   A macro which invokes the function "compile-expression" with its
;;   EXPRESSION as the sole argument and returns the code fragment
;;   produced by the same function.
;; 
;; --------------------------------------------------------------------
;; 
;; generate-content-match-code (expected-content : character)
;; generate-content-match-code (expected-content : string)
;;   A function which generates the Common Lisp code for testing the
;;   the current input source character, or a sequence of characters
;;   commencing from the current one, against a desired character or
;;   string.
;;   
;;   Upon the equality's confirmation, this code advances beyond the
;;   probed character or character sequence in the source, while
;;   returning a generalized boolean value of "true".
;;   
;;   If no match could be confirmed, the source's position cursor does
;;   not move, while the generated code delivers a generalized boolean
;;   value of "false".
;;   
;;   This function is utilized by the higher-level "match-content"
;;   macro, which please see.
;; 
;; match-content (expected-content)
;;   A macro which invokes the function "generate-content-match-code"
;;   with its EXPECTED-CONTENT as the sole argument and returns the
;;   code fragment produced by the same function.
;;   
;;   This macro may be used by the function "compile-expression", which
;;   please consult.
;; 
;; --------------------------------------------------------------------
;; 
;; generate-type-match-code (expected-type : type-specifier,
;;                           target        : place)
;;   A function which generates the Common Lisp code for testing the
;;   current input source character for its compliance with a specified
;;   type specifier.
;;   
;;   Upon the character eligibility's confirmation, this code fragment
;;   assigns the probed character to the optated target place, advances
;;   to the next character in the source, and returns a generalized
;;   boolean value of "true".
;;   
;;   If no type compliance could be attested, the code fragment neither
;;   engages in an assignment, nor in the source position cursor's
;;   advancement, instead returning a generalized boolean value of
;;   "false".
;;   
;;   This function is utilized by the higher-level "match-type" macro,
;;   which please see.
;; 
;; match-type (expected-type, place)
;;   A macro which invokes the function "generate-type-match-code"
;;   with its EXPECTED-TYPE and the PLACE as the arguments and returns
;;   the code fragment produced by the same function.
;;   
;;   This macro may be used by the function "compile-expression", which
;;   please consult.
;; 
;; == A DETAILED ACCOUNT ON META'S FUNCTIONS AND MACROS ==
;; META's original implementation, a treatise capable of consultation in
;; [baker1991prag], wists of a champarty partaking in by both macros and
;; functions, in which case the formers enjoy a more peisant parcery's
;; recipience in both significance and tally.
;; 
;; Maugre its foundational principles' retention, the solution pursued
;; in this project inclines toward an antilibration in the two operative
;; constructs' commitments, where functional definitions serves as a
;; ubiquitous substratum for the macro counterparts, their vindication
;; commorant in the potential for fungability, as the macro diorisms in
;; both their signature and implementation may be emancipated from the
;; functions responsible for the Common Lisp code fragments' production;
;; in their ultimity admitting the homologation for modulations in the
;; implementing aspects.
;; 
;; The following treatise's hyle shall accept the macro and function
;; contingency's elucidation, which in three tiers attain their
;; collaborative entelechy, proceeding from the top-level conspection
;; to the lower strata.
;; 
;; --------------------------------------------------------------------
;; 
;; ENTRY OPERATIONS WHICH GENERATE FOR RECOGNIZED META CONSTRUCTS OR
;; CHARACTER LITERALS COMMON LISP PARSING CODE
;; 
;; << function/method >>
;; compile-expression (expression : character)
;; compile-expression (expression : string)
;; compile-expression (expression : META-Object)
;;   Generates and returns a Common Lisp code fragment which probes the
;;   expression for its compatibility with the input source's current
;;   state, that is, its contemporaneously selected character or
;;   characters, responding with a generalized boolean "true" value
;;   upon its conformation, otherwise with "false".
;;   
;;   The following principles apply to the expression in dependency
;;   upon its concrete type or class:
;;   
;;     (a) If the expression represents a "META-Alternative", the
;;         generated code constitutes an OR-combination of the
;;         "META-Alternative" options' produced code fragments, each
;;         such yielded by an invocation of the option "op" in
;;         "compile-expression(op)". Please heed that an empty option
;;         set always fails; this circumstance may be harnessed to
;;         produce a logical contradiction.
;;     
;;     (b) If the expression represents a "META-Evaluation", the
;;         generated code is yielded by simply invoking the contained
;;         form.
;;     
;;     (c) If the expression represents a "META-Repetition", the
;;         generated code constitutes a loop which perpetuates as long
;;         as its contained form "f", in its evaluated guise, obtained
;;         via "compile-expression(f)", yields a generalized boolean
;;         "true" value, with the loop code finally returning a
;;         generalized boolean value of "true" itself.
;;     
;;     (d) If the expression represents a "META-Sequence", the
;;         generated code constitutes an AND-combination of the
;;         "META-Sequence" elements' produced code fragments, each
;;         such yielded by an invocation of the element "elem" in
;;         "compile-expression(elem)". Please heed that an empty
;;         sequence always matches; this circumstance may be harnessed
;;         to produce a logical tautology.
;;     
;;     (e) If the expression represents a "META-Type-Test", the
;;         generated code constitutes a "match-type" invocation, the
;;         "META-Type-Test"'s evaluated type specifier "type-spec" and
;;         its unevaluated assignment place "target" amounting to
;;         "match-type(type-spec, target)".
;;     
;;     (f) If the expression represents a character, the generated code
;;         constitutes a "match-content" invocation utilizing the
;;         expression's evaluated character form "char", amounting to
;;         "match-content(char)".
;;     
;;     (g) If the expression represents a string, the generated code
;;         constitutes a "match-content" invocation utilizing the
;;         expression's evaluated string form "str", amounting to
;;         "match-content(str)".
;;     
;;     (h) Any other expression cannot be evaluated, and thus
;;         instigates an error reaction.
;; 
;; << macro >>
;; match-expression (expression)
;;   Invokes the function "compile-expression(expression)", which in
;;   turn generates and returns a Common Lisp code fragment that probes

;;   or characters, responding with a generalized boolean "true" value
;;   upon its conformation, otherwise with "false".
;;   
;;   This macro represents the entry point into the META parser, whence

;;   "target", ere advancing the input source's position cursor to the

;; == RELATIONSHIPS BETWIXT META FUNCTIONS/MACROS INVOCATIONS ==
;; The ordonnance and principles whose coefficiency governs the META
;; parser application, airted downwards from the "match-expression"
;; macro as the top echelon's interface operation, shall be the alow
;; variation on a UML activity diagram's cynosure, where the following
;; stipulations, thilk act as sepiments in agency from the standard's
;; notions, merit to receive special heed:
;; 
;;   (1) Activities (rectangles) represent functions or macros, bearing
;;       the subsuming species as a stereotype in chevrons aboon the
;;       signature. Please also note the traditional curvature's
;;       deprivation whose expected presence in the UML design furnishes
;;       a proprium of activities as counterdinguished from data
;;       objects, and the same in our case, with its disencumberance
;;       from the latter species of component, ostends a stringently
;;       orthogonal conformation, while yet retaining its agency as an
;;       activity's succedaneum.
;;   
;;   (2) Transitions (arrows) serve to simulate function or macro
;;       invocations.
;;   
;;   (3) Recursive stevenings are unraveled; that is, a reference to a
;;       function or macro already extant at another location in the
;;       diagram, without discrimination of its paregal or modulated
;;       status, will be limned in a separate activity, in lieu of a
;;       transition to the present one.

;; == READER MACROS GENERATE CODE BY CALLBACKS WHEN DETECTING SYMBOLS ==
;; The claviger to the META parser's approximation of regular
;; expressions in the matter of its syntactical conspection is furnished
;; in the septuple accompt of reader macro definitions; whence ensues,
;; by a modulation applied to the Common Lisp environment' syntaxis, the
;; capacitation for a compendious design.
;; 
;; Please recall that one of the aspirations inherent to META maintains
;; its existency in a similacrum to regular expressions as an enhaused
;; syntomy's provenance. The dioristic traditions vauncing from siccan
;; expressions' designment are molded into the malleable Common Lisp
;; syntax by mediation of the aforementioned reader macro
;; infrastructure, to whom the governance over a bespoke lexical
;; analyzation and parsing of the Lisp source code is imparted.
;; 
;; Upon a registered macro character's recognition in the code, the
;; standard Lisp reader's wike experiences an abeyance, instead
;; redirecting the control flow to a callback function affiliated with
;; this instigating symbol whose propagation ceases with the responsible
;; function's cessation. This handler's onus manifests in the generation
;; and returning of a valid piece of Common Lisp code, thilk, as a
;; consequence of the function's conclusion, immediately consigns to the
;; standard Lisp reader's castaldy, evaluation, and execution.
;; 
;; If, as an example adduced, the entity "$" commits to an engagement
;; with a reader macro as a macro character, maintaining a lealty with

;; == SEVEN READER MACROS GOVERN THE META EXPRESSIONS GENERATION ==
;; In our META project's particular circumstance, siccan reader macro
;; definition for the symbol "$" may be chosen in this fashion:
;; 
;;   (set-macro-character #\$
;;     #'(lambda (stream macro-character)
;;         (declare (type stream    stream))
;;         (declare (type character macro-character))
;;         (declare (ignore         macro-character))
;;         (let ((form-to-repeat (read stream)))
;;           (declare (type T form-to-repeat))
;;           (the META-Repetition
;;             (make-meta-repetition form-to-repeat)))))
;; 
;; Please heed in the aboon exemplary tmema that the variable
;; "form-to-repeat" constitutes a piece of supererogation: The
;; ``META-Repetition'' instance, produced by adminiculum of the
;; constructor ``make-meta-repetition'', enjoys the homologation of the
;; ``(read stream)'' result's immediate consumption. As a consectary,
;; the principle of owelty with the more detailed solution applies to
;; the definition
;; 
;;   (set-macro-character #\$
;;     #'(lambda (stream macro-character)
;;         (declare (type stream    stream))
;;         (declare (type character macro-character))
;;         (declare (ignore         macro-character))
;;         (the META-Repetition
;;           (make-meta-repetition
;;             (read stream)))))
;; 
;; In the case of the META technique, the reader macros apply themselves
;; to shorthand notations' provisions, everichon from this membership
;; responsible for a specific META expression type's assemblage and
;; instantiation, by which agency the necessity of explicit META object
;; creations is rendered an otiose emprise.
;; 
;; These seven members shall receive a more reified ilk of elucidation:

;; Appendices
;; ==========
;; A certain set of topics' involvement may be delivered to one's
;; apprehension to whom a gravity meted above pure autotelic assay
;; can be assigned; yet no elevation to a plenipotentiary for the
;; intrusion into this treatise's chief body constitutes a thing of
;; vouchsafement. Material of such medioxumous meed shall establish the
;; coming sections' cynosure.
;; 
;; == APPENDIX A: META'S REQUISITES AS DEMANDS TO THE LANGUAGE ==
;; One rationale for the META concept's development in Common Lisp
;; may be discovered in the faculties levied against its implementing
;; programming language, thilk, as a sequela to this Lisp dialect's
;; natural accommodations, conduces the twain's historical alligation.
;; 
;; The set of necessitated competences that a programming language in
;; its desideration of the META technique's implementation per force
;; ought to adduce as the compliance's vouch shall be the following
;; enumeration's subject:
;; 
;;   (1) CODE GENERATION CAPABILITIES
;;       The declaimed diorism of META as a warklume for the
;;       *CONSTRUCTION* of a parser, rather than simply its actuation,
;;       manifests in an approach that generates and assembles the code
;;       in the source language.
;;       
;;       As a consectary, a programming language desiderating this
;;       technique's involvement ought to provide the contingency for
;;       its own code evaluation. The emphasis is empighted on the
;;       output of code, akin to a template with variable segments, as
;;       counterdistinguished from computation results. For instance,
;;       such a productive facility would, for the cause of a printing
;;       behest, respond with an exemplary program tmema
;;         
;;         (print "Hello")
;;       
;;       in lieu of the actual printing of message
;;       
;;         "Hello"
;;       
;;       In an eath and simplified parlance, the requisite is levied
;;       upon functions to return code fragments compatible with the
;;       language itself, admissible for future execution.
;;       
;;       In Common Lisp, this dever befalls the general macro
;;       infrastructure, obtainable via "defmacro" specifications.
;;       
;;       A simplified example, endeictic in its potential and, albeit
;;       didascalic, executable, shall limn the explicated concept.
;;       Please heed that the function ``compile-expression'' forms the
;;       code's cynosure.
;;       
;;         (declaim (type simple-string *source-code*))
;;         (declaim (type fixnum        *current-position*))
;;         (declaim (type character     *current-character*))
;;         
;;         (defparameter *source-code*      "sparrow")
;;         (defparameter *current-position* 0)
;;         
;;         (define-symbol-macro *current-character*
;;           (the character
;;             (schar *source-code* *current-position*)))
;;         
;;         ;; Generate and return, but do not yet execute, code which
;;         ;; matches the EXPECTED-CHARACTER against the
;;         ;; *CURRENT-CHARACTER*.
;;         (defun compile-expression (expected-character)
;;           (declare (type character expected-character))
;;           `(when (and (< *current-position*
;;                          (length *source-code*))
;;                       (char= *current-character*
;;                              ,expected-character))
;;              (incf *current-position*)
;;              T))
;;         
;;         ;; Execute the character matching code requested from the
;;         ;; function "COMPILE-EXPRESSION".
;;         (defmacro match-expression (expression)
;;           (compile-expression expression))
;;       
;;       The function ``compile-expression'' assembles a Common Lisp
;;       code tmema which may be evaluated later on without its
;;       immediate execution; instead delivering the fragment as its
;;       return value. The ``match-expression'' macro accepts the thus
;;       delineated code parcel, evaluates thilk, and thus accompasses
;;       its appertaining causata, in addition to its contingent
;;       resulting outputs.
;;   
;;   (2) INTEGRABLE SYNTAX CUSTOMIZATIONS
;;       The ultimity of its deployment appertains for the META parser
;;       in its services' immediate integration into the amplecting
;;       source code, their actuation's intention communicated via
;;       particular symbols.
;;       
;;       In order to auspiciously pursue this telos, the implementing
;;       programming language's compass ought to homologate the
;;       definition of bespoke syntactical configurations, which
;;       establishes a tantamount to the syntaxis' extension or
;;       modification.
;;       
;;       In the Common Lisp realm, such capacitation is elicitated by
;;       mediation of reader macros, thilk permit the introduction of a
;;       custom design in the standard's stipulations. The consequent
;;       malleability provides for this Lisp dialect's widely propagated
;;       covenableness for the realization of domain-specific language
;;       (DSL) integrations.
;;       
;;       As a forbisen, the code tmema
;;       
;;         (match-expression
;;           $[@(decimal-digit current-character)
;;             !(progn (print current-character) T)])
;;       
;;       demonstrates the reservations of the characters "$", "[", "]",
;;       "@", and "!" for certain objectives, which trigger the
;;       execution of routines implemented by the programmer, that is,
;;       their personally imposed lexical analyzation and parsing
;;       procedures. Destitute of reader macros, these symbols would
;;       introduce the etiologies for errors, being meaningless in the
;;       default Common Lisp syntax.
;; 
;; A veridicous affedavit to the META technique transcription's
;; potential across other environments attests its tendance in the
;; programming language "Dylan" [dylanhackers2024opendylan] for whom a
;; dedicated library, euonymous in its agnomination as "Meta",
;; [dylanhackers2024metalibrary], and accommodated for the particular
;; specimen's propria, tallies among the afforded avails.
;; 
;; == APPENDIX B: META'S DISENCUMBRANCE FROM THE SOURCE OBJECT ==
;; A kenspeckle attribute commorant in META's approach pertains to its
;; disencumberance from the submitted source's designment: The lexical
;; analyzation and parsing stages most commonly expect the received
;; input to subsume into a string or a stream species; META is
;; counterdistinguished in this aspect by its lack of such imposing
;; covenant. Any object admissible to the Common-Lisp-internal
;; evaluation mechanism may be induced into the analyzation process and
;; incorporated into the assemblage stage.
;; 
;; This liberty ensues from the special META expressions' actuations,
;; which, when operated, query their necessitated arguments from the
;; input source, usually by adminiculum of the autochthonous function
;; "read", thilk consumes the subsequent form from the Lisp code and
;; returns a covenable datum in compliance with the Common Lisp
;; standard for its personal detection tier. The thus produced object
;; may register its membership among any conceivable type, for instance,
;; a character, a string, a symbol, or a list.
;; 
;; In a pseudocode diction, Procrustean to all tongues of programming,
;; one would conceive:
;; 
;;   let nextObject <- programStream.read()
;; 
;; In Common Lisp's concrete parlance, a forbisen entalented with owelty
;; limns:
;;   (let ((next-object (read program-stream)))
;;     ;; [...]
;;   )
;; 
;; The contingency of paravaunt interest for these purposes shall be
;; the ostended in the below apercu. No potential for the avail's
;; exhaustion is purported by this listing.
;; 
;;   ------------------------------------------------------------------
;;   Operation | Causatum
;;   ----------+-------------------------------------------------------
;;   read      | Consumes and returns the next Common Lisp object in
;;             | compliance with the language standard's interpretation
;;             | rules. The yielded result may be of any admissible
;;             | type.
;;   ..................................................................
;;   read-char | Consumes and returns the next character.
;;   ..................................................................
;;   read-line | Consumes, commencing from the current position and
;;             | terminating immediately before the nearest following
;;             | linebreak character, or with the input's exhaustion,
;;             | an entire line and returns its string representation.
