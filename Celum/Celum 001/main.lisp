;; 
;; This program implements an interpreter for the esoteric programming
;; language "Celum", invented by the Esolang user "Zzo38" and presented
;; on October 21st, 2006, based upon two conspicuous characteristics,
;; the first constituting the line-based nature of the syntax and the
;; resulting capabilities of conditional jumping betwixt these, the
;; second being its infinite tape whose bit-valued cells may only be
;; manipulated by applying an elementary cellular automaton unto their
;; content.
;; 
;; 
;; Concept
;; =======
;; The Celum programming language is founded upon a sequence of lines,
;; each prefixed with a bit, followed by an optional label name, and
;; concluding in a series of instructions, the same operate on an
;; infinite tape of bit-valued cells. Most conspicuously, these
;; facilities incorporate an elementary cellular automaton application
;; specimen, which, in the face of direct lacking cell manipulations,
;; such can be found in Urban Mueller's "brainfuck", for instance,
;; alters the memory's design.
;; 
;; == CELUM PROGRAMS: COMPOSITIONS OF LINES ==
;; In the general case, a Celum program line's composition adheres to
;; the forbisen
;; 
;;   prefix:label:commands
;;   ****** ***** ********
;; 
;; The prefix expects a bit value from the numeric set {0, 1}, whereas
;; the label establishes an optional entity for control flow mechanisms,
;; the liberty of which is exemplified by the capacity to submit an
;; an empty character sequence, as well as the homologation of duplicate
;; identifiers across the program. The commands comprehend a series
;; of zero or more operations defining the line's effect.
;; 
;; A particular species of line, a commentary exemplary, may be inserted
;; at any location by the prefix' substitution with the "c" or "C"
;; symbol:
;; 
;;   C:commentText
;;   c:commentText
;; 
;; Such apostils do not contribute any causata and are subjected to
;; neglect.
;; 
;; == PREFIX BITS: NAVIGATIONAL ANCHORS ==
;; The prefix bit's telos manifests in the contingency for navigational
;; exercises, perpetuated by a twain of operations which alter the
;; tape's central bit as a parasceve to the search for the next line in
;; the specified direction whose prefix matches the new tape center.
;; 
;; == LINE LABELS: GOTO TARGETS ==
;; As an important instance of supererogation from the prefix bit, the
;; line label names may be employed for the control flow's helming. Such
;; a goto attempt, seeking downwards from the current line, and wrapping
;; around until having either matched the identifier, or alternatively
;; reached the provenance line without success, upon ascertainment of
;; its telos' accomplishment, relocates the instruction pointer to the
;; start of the first eligible line; otherwise, the program is
;; terminated in immediacy.
;; 
;; == THE TAPE: AN INFINITE TAPE OF BITS ==
;; The paravaunt component of Celum's memory, a tape of infinite expanse
;; along both lateralities, and composed of a bits only, accommodates
;; the necessary data storage capability.
;; 
;; The central bit appropriates a cynosure's rank, as a preponderance
;; among the available operations is accompassed in regard to this unit.
;; 
;; The dioristic indicium commorant in the language, direct cell
;; manipulations are inflicted with a lacuna; instead, a reliance upon
;; an elementary cellular automaton rule for the entire tape's
;; recomputation is necessitated, or a command twissel, dedicated to the
;; central bit's inversion and subsequent search for a line prefixed
;; with the new bit value, ought to be issued.
;; 
;; For a cursory ilk of treatise on the topic involving elementary
;; cellular automata, please refer to the subsection
;; "Appendix A: ELEMENTARY CELLULAR AUTOMATA", subsumed into the
;; "Appendices" parent section.
;; 
;; == THE BIT FLAG: A GOTO ADMINICULUM ==
;; A second memory component, albeit conspicable parvipotent in
;; juxtaposition with the tape, is realized in the program's independent
;; bit flag, a bit-valued scalar sentinel whose manipulation ensues from
;; an attempted control flow redirection via label names, and whose
;; potential's entelechy exercises influence with the conditional
;; command skipping instruction, the same omits the current line's
;; remaining commands upon the bit flag's assumption of the value zero
;; (0).
;; 
;; == INPUT AND OUTPUT PROCEED BITWISE AND BUFFERED ==
;; A further element entalented with a kenspeckle demarcation relates to
;; the input and output facilities, accompassing their capacities with a
;; mode of guttation: based upon bits and buffering. Both components'
;; entelech issues in an airt from the least significant bit (LSB)
;; towards the most significant position (MSB).
;; 
;; == THE INPUT BUFFER: CHARACTER BITS GRADUALLY WRITTEN TO THE TAPE ==
;; A proprium of the input buffer manifests in its position cursor,
;; at the inchoation empighted on the least significant location, its
;; course being airted in gradual progression towards the higher-valued
;; bits.
;; 
;; An input command invocation provides an assessment's impetus: For a
;; vacant buffer, the the standard input conduit is queried for a single
;; ASCII character; the input buffer subsequently commits the received
;; character's ASCII code in its binary form to its own salvatory.
;; 
;; Such an initialized input buffer's reaction, commencing immediately
;; with the character's reception, reproduces the bit located at its
;; cursor in the tape's central position, while as an epiphenomenon
;; concomitantly advancing the same one step towards the most
;; significant bit place. No further interaction's necessitation ensues
;; until this highest bit's transport unto the tape. The transcendence's
;; ultimity, the desinent bit's transfer purges the buffer, resetting
;; its status to an empty sequence, and its position cursor to the least
;; significant location. A subsequently issued input operation will
;; iterum instigate the character reception and evaluation explicated
;; aboon.
;; 
;; == THE OUTPUT BUFFER: A TAPE'S BIT GATHERED INTO A BYTE ==
;; Its similitude to the input compernage ligates the output buffer to
;; a siclike stillatitious comportment.
;; 
;; At its in incipiency, the output buffer's position cursor registers
;; its occupancy at the least significant bit location, responding to a
;; print request by a transfer of the tape's middle bit to the cursor
;; locality, while advancing this marker one step towards the opposing
;; laterality. A display command does not elicit an unconditional output
;; reaction: Only if the most significant bit in the buffer has been
;; set, the completed octet's transcription into the corresponding ASCII
;; character and its commission to the standard output conduit is
;; accompassed, followed by the output buffer's purging, the same
;; renders its state tantamount to its pristine configuration.
;; 
;; 
;; Architecture
;; ============
;; Celum's architecture is delineated by a twain of components: the
;; bilaterally infinite bit-valued tape, and an independent bit flag.
;; 
;; == THE TAPE: AN INFINITE BIT VECTOR ==
;; The paravaunt material of deliberations in the context of the program
;; memory is imposed by the tape, an bilaterally unbounded expanse of
;; cells, each such a salvatory to an aefauld bit. Maugre its
;; innumerable mickleness, the central or middle bit appropriates a
;; dioristic significance, as a majority among the operations relay to
;; its perquisition or manipulation, incorporated into this set, the
;; kenspeckle elementary cellular automaton application.
;; 
;; == THE BIT FLAG: AN COMMAND OMISSION SWITCH ==
;; A paravail echolon's commorant, the bit flag, inchoated with a value
;; of zero (0), and inverted in its content by a line label search, may
;; be exploited in order to conditionally skip a line's remaining
;; commands, acting in this agency if the zero (0) state concurs with
;; the skipping command "?".
;; 
;; 
;; Data Types
;; ==========
;; Celum's type hierarchy wists of two species only: bits as the most
;; important contributors, and ASCII character which operate on the
;; communication channels.
;; 
;; 
;; Syntax
;; ======
;; A Celum program is compact of lines, each one designated by a
;; bit-valued prefix, an optional label, and a conditory to zero or more
;; instructions.
;; 
;; == LINE PATTERN ==
;; A particular forbisen's adhibition determines the format of any
;; effective line, rendering it a tripartite construct:
;; 
;;   (a) A mandatory bit value, equal either to 0 or 1, determines a
;;       potential jump target, followed by a colon.
;;   (b) A contingently empty label name, whose characters must be
;;       commorants of the ASCII code range [33, 126], excluding the
;;       colon (":"), as a second variant of jump target follows,
;;       succeeded by a further colon.
;;   (c) A sequence of zero or more instructions manifests the line's
;;       actual effects.
;; 
;; == LINEBREAKS ==
;; The installation of linebreaks constitutes a significant element in
;; the Celum source code, forecause its programs distribute along rows
;; amenable to be targeted by several jump instructions.
;; 
;; Tolerance is administer to vacant lines.
;; 
;; == SPACES ==
;; In all aspects, instances of the space character may be introduced
;; liberally without an influence upon the code's construe.
;; 
;; == COMMENTS ==
;; The language circumference attends to comments by lines whose prefix
;; bit is substituted by the character "c" or "C", followed by a colon
;; (":"), and any content to whom the respective line's entirety is
;; allotted, concluding, as any row, with the newline character or the
;; end of the program.
;; 
;; == GRAMMAR==
;; The following Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) serves in the
;; delineation of the language's donat:

;; Instructions
;; ============
;; The compass of Celum's instruction set embraces seven members, the
;; most kenspeckle of which being the elementary cellular
;; automaton-based tape cell modifier. Further operations for input and
;; output are complemented by navigation specimens, switching to program
;; lines by adminiculum of some condition.
;; 
;; == INSTRUCTION TYPES ==
;; Celum's instructions may be regarded with augmented cohesion by
;; applying a subsumption unto its members into three possible tiers:
;; 
;;   - Cell modifying operations
;;     o The language relies on a very dioristic warklume for its tape
;;       cells' modification by its desistence for direct manipulation
;;       in favor of the application of an elementary cellular automaton
;;       rule on the whole infinite memory.
;;   - Input/Output facilities
;;     o The language incorporates a command for the prompting of a bit
;;       from the user, as well as a counterpart for a bit's printing to
;;       to the standard output.
;;     o Both operations appertaining to the central cell on the tape.
;;   - Navigational instructions
;;     o The preponderance of the instruction set targets the relocation
;;       of the line pointer in respondency to some criterion.
;;     o Two jump instruction variants can be distinguished:
;;       (i)  Bit-prefix based jumping: A line prefixed by a specified
;;            bit shall be detected.
;;       (ii) Label-based jumping: A line with a specified label shall
;;            be detected.
;;     o In addition, an instruction skipping operation exists which
;;       relies on the state of the Boolean flag.
;; 
;; == OVERVIEW ==
;; The septuple instruction set shall be subjected to a cursory
;; indagation:
;; 
;;   ------------------------------------------------------------------

;;   hh      | Converts the two hexadecimal digits {hh} into a decimal
;;   **      | value and executes the elementary cellular automaton
;;           | rule corresponding with the same on the whole tape.
;;   ..................................................................
;;   i       | If the input buffer is empty, queries the standard input
;;           | conduit for an ASCII character and stores its bits in
;;           | the input buffer.
;;           | In any case, proceeding from the least significant bit
;;           | (LSB) to the most significant one (MSB), copies the bit
;;           | at the buffer's cursor position to the central cell of
;;           | the tape, while advancing the cursor one step towards
;;           | the most significant bit.
;;           | If the last bit has been thus processed, purges the
;;           | input buffer, rendering it empty, and resets the cursor
;;           | to the first, least significant, position.
;;   ..................................................................
;;   o       | Proceeding from the least significant bit (LSB) of the
;;           | output buffer towards the most significant one (MSB),
;;           | stores the tape's central bit in the in buffer at its

;;           | into the direction of the most significant bit.
;;           | If this highest location has been set, the output
;;           | buffer's content is interpreted as a decimal integer,
;;           | the corresponding ASCII character is printed to the

;; 
;;   ------------------------------------------------------------------

;; Lacunae in the Specification
;; ============================
;; The rather curt circumference administered to its explications, in
;; champarty with the a dearth in examples, inflicts the Celum
;; specification with an etiology for ambiguities, whence a subset shall
;; be desumed for more meticulous perquisition.
;; 
;; == HOW SHALL A PROGRAM REACT TO A MISSING PREFIX BIT? ==
;; A discrepancy from the label-based line searching operation, the
;; ultimity of a prefix bit's failed inquisition has not been specified
;; by the original language standard.
;; 
;; A treble of possible tendance variants rede their acquisition:
;; 
;;   (1) ERROR ELICITATION:
;;       A failure to locate the desired bit on a line instigates an
;;       error of the type "MissingPrefixLineError", the fatality woning
;;       inside of its ponderance immediately terminates the program in
;;       an anomalous and uncontrolled manner.
;;       This species of amenability ostends a patent concinnity with
;;       the Boolfuck programming language, ligated by consanguinity in
;;       many aspects, embracing also a failure on a mismatched jump or
;;       loop boundary.
;;   
;;   (2) TERMINATIION:
;;       The missing prefix bit's ascertainment immediately terminates
;;       the program in a regulated manner.
;;       Such a deportment would introduce a vinculum betwixt the
;;       bit-based search commodity and the label matching compernage.
;;   
;;   (3) NEGLECT:
;;       The instruction pointer simply ignores the failed control flow
;;       attempt and advances to the next command on the current line.
;; 
;; It has been adjudged, proceeding from the Boolfuck equivalency, to
;; impute the first (1) behavior as the canonical response, its presence
;; a mimicry of the stringency commorant in common iteration bournes
;; matching.
;; 
;; == HOW SHALL INPUT AND OUTPUT BE ACTUATED? ==
;; Celum's protolog, in its command listing's perimeter, relates of the
;; input and output commodities as simply issuing or receiving the
;; central bit from the tape; its section dedicated to the equiparation
;; with the Boolfuck programming language, natheless, intimates a more
;; complex buffering deportment.
;; 
;; It has been adjudged that the entheus from Boolfuck most probably
;; specifies the communication principles, employing buffers for this
;; wike. A consectary yielded by this alternative capacitates Celum
;; programs with character-based input and output competences, as
;; counterdistinguished from the athwart restriction to binary digits.
;; 
;; 
;; Implementation
;; ==============
;; This interpreter has been implemented in the programming language
;; Common Lisp, realized by intrining the stages of lexical analyzation,
;; parsing, and actual interpretation, with the former twissel conflated
;; into an nearly inextricable union.
;; 
;; 
;; Appendices
;; ==========
;; Those subjects whose eligibility has been not been avered by this
;; project author's exercised act of docimasy a thing of essential
;; contribution, yet whom some peisant mete's commorancy attributes an
;; at least cursory ilk of perquisition, shall be the coming sections'
;; cynosure.
;; 
;; == APPENDIX A: ELEMENTARY CELLULAR AUTOMATA ==
;; The elementary cellular automata establish a specific species in the
;; cellular automaton realm, restricted in their foundational structure
;; to a single dimension, a line compact of a series of bit-valued
;; cells, which, employing three-bit neighborhoods, obey to a set of
;; 256 rules, enumerated by the integer values in the range [0, 255],
;; the same, when expressed in base-2, prescribe two-state patterns.
;; 
;; The three-bit neighborhood acts in the agency of a key, selecting
;; from the chosen rule's binary pattern an aefauld bit to harness, for
;; the anagenesis' subsequent generation, as the new cell state. New
;; generations usually do not veridically supersede their ancestors, and
;; are instead empighted on a fresh line below, the resulting chronicle
;; exhibiting a dioristic texture as a dependency of time.
;; 
;; The following visualization shall serve an endeictic wike in the
;; reproduction of the rule 126 across 24 generations. Please note that
;; the complete composition proceeded from a single bit in the topmost
;; line, with any subsequent row having been born out of the previous
;; one by the rule's adhibition.

;; == THIS TREATISE'S STRUCTURE: FROM THE BASICS TO THE NUCLEUS ==
;; The following treatise applies itself to a very rudimentary ilk of
;; its pursued nortelry's dispersion, at its inchoation administering a
;; parasceuastic apercu regarding the binary numeral system and its
;; contribution to the elementary cellular automaton rules, ere the
;; actual vincula's exposition ensues.
;; 
;; == EVERY BINARY SEQUENCE CORRESPONDS TO EXACTLY ONE DECIMAL NUMBER ==
;; The binary system establishes an equivalency to its decimal
;; counterpart, the latter of which employs the ten digits
;; 
;;   0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
;; 
;; whereas the former, maugre its equipollence, relies on a twissel of
;; symbols only:
;; 
;;   0, 1
;; 
;; Each member from this twain is also norned a "bit".
;; 
;; For our purposes, the infinite set of integer values is restricted
;; to the unsigned byte, or octet, portion that covers the closed
;; interval [0, 255]. The following table shall adhibit a foundational
;; piece of gnarity concerning the binary representation of all elements
;; from this restricted integral selection:

;; sequence of eight bits, a unique bit pattern or binary pattern.

;; the "bit key", shall be explicated with stark compendiousness in a
;; precis:
;; 
;;   (1) Three consecutive bits define an integral value in the range
;;       [0, 7].
;;   (2) Every integer value in the range [0, 255] can be represented
;;       by eight bits.
;;   (3) Each bit in this 8-bit binary representation answers to an
;;       index, or position designator, in the range [0, 7].
;;   (4) Thus, each bit of an 8-bit binary sequence is capable of being
;;       addressed by either this [0, 7]-decimal index, or the
;;       tantamount 3-bit equivalent.
;;   (5) Such a 3-bit encoding of the [0, 7]-index shall be norned the
;;       8-bit pattern's "bit key".
;;   (6) In conclusion: A bit key constitutes three bits, encoding a
;;       decimal number in the range [0, 7], the latter represents the
;;       position, or index, of a bit in an 8-bit sequence or pattern.
;; 
;; == ELEMENTARY CELLULAR AUTOMATON RULES: A PARASCEVE ==
;; A parasceuastic linkage betwixt the concept of elementary cellular
;; automaton rules and the insights hitherto derived from our treatise
;; shall yark the reader for coming, more detailed paragraphs:
;; 
;;   (1) An elementary cellular automaton rule, or simply "rule", is a
;;       unique binary pattern composed of eight (8) bits.
;;   (2) Such an 8-bit binary representation maps naturally to an
;;       integer number in the decimal range [0, 255].
;;   (3) The decimal value of an 8-bit binary pattern constitutes a
;;       rule's name. This is known as as a "Wolfram code".
;;   (4) Every bit in the 8-bit binary pattern answers to an index in
;;       the decimal range [0, 7].
;;   (5) Any among these [0, 7]-indices corresponds to a 3-bit binary
;;       number, the bit key.
;;   (6) In conclusion: Every bit of an 8-bit binary pattern, produced
;;       by the rule's decimal name, in fact specifies what happens if
;;       three bits in a particular combination are supplied ---
;;       concretely, which bit will be returned by the rule.
;; 
;; == A RULE PRODUCES FOR A TRIAD OF BITS AN OUTPUT BIT ==
;; Every decimal integer number in the range [0, 255] actually defines a
;; rule: It produces a distinct 8-bit binary pattern. Every bit in this
;; pattern can be addressed by an index, or position, in the range
;; [0, 7]. Every such decimal index can be replicated by a combination
;; of three bits: the bit key. As a corollary, every bit in the 8-bit
;; pattern answers unambiguously to a 3-bit bit key.
;; 
;; Given a rule, designated by the name "rule", where rule is an integer
;; number in the range [0, 255], and a bit key, composed of three bits,
;; the rule responds with a bit of its underlying 8-bit binary pattern.
;; In a more formal diction:
;; 
;;   applyRule (rule : integer in [0, 255], bitKey : bit[3]) => bit
;; 
;; An example shall illustrate this concept:
;; 
;;   Given
;;     - the automaton rule 30, which represents the decimal number 30,
;;       and assumes the binary pattern 00011110,
;;     - and a key bitKey = 101, the same addresses the bit at index 5,
;;   we obtain 0, as it holds:
;;   
;;      Binary value of decimal 30: 00011110
;;                                    ^
;;                                    |
;;                                   The bit at index 5 equals 0.
;;   
;;   A conspection of this result's cause can be derived from the
;;   acquainted bit key table for the decimal number 30, here extended
;;   by the bit position as the decimal equivalent of the 3-bit key.

;;   The significant line has been emphasized.
;; 
;; Applying such a rule-bitKey combination to some series of input bit
;; triads, a new pattern of bits would be generated. Interestingly, the
;; result displays in the most frequent cases a very attractive weftage.
;; 
;; == A RULE APPLIED TO A SEQUENCE OF LINES PRODUCES A PATTERN ==
;; The fact of a rule's corresponds to three bits, the bit key, with a
;; new bit does neither imbue us with mazement, afflatus, nor a soupcon
;; of thaumaturgy; its most conspectible encheson for alliciency wones
;; in the visual causata to whom it lends a vehicle.
;; 
;; In more concrete diction, if applied to a row of zero-valued bits,
;; the extent of which founds upon one's personal delectation, employing
;; a sliding window of three bits as the bit keys, the thus modified
;; line carries a distinct texture --- produced entirely as a response
;; to the selected automaton rule and the initial line's pattern.
;; 
;; A fortiori, if, in lieu of the incipient line's direct modification,
;; one appends a new zero-valued bit row below the extant one, and
;; enters the rule application results formed by the first line's
;; traversal into this new section, subsequently repeating the process
;; with this second line as the new template for a third expanse, et
;; cetera, the thus spanned rectangular grid ostends a very kenspeckle
;; picture, unique for any of the 256 possible rules.
;; 
;; This process, molded into the superior stringency and formality of a
;; gradual explication, shall be limned in the following:
;; 
;;   (0) SELECT BIT SOURCE AND ELEMENTARY CELLULAR AUTOMATON RULE:
;;       (0.1) Prepare a line composed of N bits, the cells initialized
;;             to some inchoate state from the set of bits {0, 1}. Most
;;             commonly, the center cell is set to 1, while all
;;             surrounding units assume the value 0. As a forbisen, a
;;             horizontal expanse compact of five cells (N=5), would
;;             assume the guise:
;;               0 0 1 0 0
;;                   ^
;;                   |_ Only the middle cells contains 1, all others 0.
;;             
;;             The first line provides the incipiency for an arbitrary
;;             tally of lines to follow, designated in their entirety,
;;             including the first row, by a number H >= 0.
;;             
;;             A more imperious terminology, paravaunt in its kinship to

;;             "generations", the incipiency of which the zero-th
;;             specimen. In this disquisition at hand, however, we
;;             prefer the visual intimiations of the geometrical

;;             
;;             A specific bit of the h-th line, again zero-indexed, is

;;   
;;   (1) SET CURSOR TO FIRST LINE:
;;       Set the cursor, or index, h for the following stages to 0,
;;       designating the incipient row:
;;         h <- 0
;;   
;;   (2) ITERATE THROUGH ALL SOURCE BITS, FORMING A BIT KEY FOR EACH:
;;       In the current line, lines[h], at the processed line index h,
;;       iterate with a variable i from 0 to (N-1); and for each bit
;;       bits[h][i], form a bit key composed of three bits, the bitKey:
;;         bits[h][i]   provides the center,
;;         bits[h][i-1] its sinistral neighbor cell, and
;;         bits[h][i+1] the dextral bit,
;;       resulting in the triad sequence:
;;         bitKey <- (bits[h][i-1], bits[h][i], bits[h][i+1])
;;       As an apostil:
;;         bits[h][i-1] accommodates the most significant bit
;;         bits[h][i]   accommodates the next lower bit
;;         bits[h][i+1] accommodates the least significant bit

;;                 |               |               |
;;                 V               V               V
;;          +--------------+ +------------+ +--------------+
;;          | bits[h][i-1] | | bits[h][i] | | bits[h][i+1] |
;;          +--------------+ +------------+ +--------------+
;;       
;;       If any of the two neighbors, bits[h][i-1] or bits[h][i+1],
;;       specify an invalid position, one outside of the line's bournes,
;;       any of three possible actions may be adhibited:
;;       
;;         (a) DEFAULT VALUE:
;;             The outlying cell is substituted by a constant bit,
;;             commonly 0.
;;         (b) WRAPPING AROUND:
;;             The outlying cell "wraps around" and assumes the bit on
;;             the opposite end of the line:
;;               bits[h][i-1], the left neighbor, thus acquires the bit
;;                             located at the end of the line:
;;                               bits[h][N-1].
;;               bits[h][i+1], the right neighbor, appropriates the bit
;;                             at the start of the line:
;;                               bits[h][0].
;;         (c) OMISSION:
;;             Such an ambiguous case is simply obviated by commencing
;;             and concluding the iteration process one cell before the
;;             bournes, that is, the first and the last line cell are
;;             not processed, retained verbatim in the next line.
;;             In lieu of iterating with i from 0 to (N-1), for a line
;;             of N cells, one progresses from 1 to (N-2),
;;   
;;   (3) APPLY RULE TO THE CURRENT LINE, BIT FOR BIT:
;;       Query the rule "rule" for the bit which it associates with the
;;       3-bit combination bitKey --- the same is tantamount to the
;;       decimal integer index among the rule's binary pattern for said
;;       key:
;;         outputBit <- applyRule(rule, bitKey),
;;        where
;;         rule   --- the rule, identified by its decimal number in the
;;                    integral [0, 255]
;;         bitKey --- the three-bit bitKey, actually referencing in its
;;                    decimal equivalency the bit position into the
;;                    "rule"'s binary pattern.
;;   
;;   (4) WRITE RULE OUTPUT TO LINE BELOW:
;;       Write the outputBit, computed for the i-th cell of the current
;;       line, to the i-th cell of the next line, which is located at
;;       the row position (h+1), that is, the cell immediately below the
;;       currently iterated line bitKey's center bit:
;;         bits[h+1][i] <- outputBut
;;       In a visually more expressive manner:
;;       
;;                      +--------------+--------------+--------------+
;;         lines[h]:    | bits[h][i-1] |  bits[h][i]  | bits[h][i+1] |
;;                      +--------------+--------------+--------------+
;;                                            |
;;                                            | write in cell below, to
;;                                            | bits[h+1][i]
;;                                            | 
;;                                            V
;;                                     +--------------+
;;                                     |  outputBit   |
;;         lines[h+1]:                 |..............|
;;                                     | bits[h+1][i] |
;;                                     +--------------+
;;   
;;   (5) REPEAT FOR NEXT LINE:
;;       Repeat this process, starting at the stage (2), for the next
;;       line by setting the current line index h to (h+1):
;;         h <- h + 1
;;       Perpetuate these steps (2) through (5) until h reaches the
;;       desinent line index (H-1), that is, until:
;;         h >= H - 1
;; 
;; == THE CELLS MAY BE ORNAMENTED IN AN ARBITRARY FASHION ==
;; The stringency of its mathematical substrate, the supputations
;; implemented in the realm of bits as members desumed from the integral
;; set {0, 1}, does not impose a requisitum for the aesthetical aspects.
;; 
;; Concretely, one is not obliged to display the rectangular grid of

;; == DEFINITIONS ==
;; In a rather withershins procession, the diorisms and contexts of
;; terms and concepts appertaining to the elementary cellular automaton
;; shall now be introduced as the practical segment's coda.
;; 
;; == CELLULAR AUTOMATON: A GRID OF CELLS ==
;; A *cellular automaton*, abbreviated as CA, furnishes a computational
;; model, discrete and abstract in its nature, occupying a grid, regular
;; in its ordonnance, and inhabited by cells capacitated to assume a
;; finite tally of states.
;; 
;; == A CELL IS DEFINED BY ITS STATE ==
;; At any instant woning in exactly one state, a cell's competence
;; amplects a transition into another from the recognized set through
;; a champarty of its vincula with its neighbors and the automaton rule.
;; 
;; In a very simple case, a dichotomy in conformance with binary values
;; exhausts the complete state roster.
;; 
;; == CELLS REACT TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD ==
;; Besides its state, a second proprium applying to a cell is realized
;; in its neighborhood, a certain perimeter comprehending the cells in
;; its vicinage, the selection of which is governed by some regulation,
;; and whose affluence serves as a contribution to a cell state's
;; development.
;; 
;; == A RULE MODIFIES A CELL BASED UPON ITS STATE AND NEIGHBORHOOD ==
;; A compernage to the neighborhood, the indicium of most peisant
;; influence constitutes the cellular automaton rule, or simply rule,
;; to whom the competence is imparted to supputate for a cell, founded
;; upon its current state and its neighboring cells, a new state,
;; intended to be assigned to the perquired cell in a subsequent stage
;; and override its contemporaneous content.
;; 
;; == GENERATIONS: ALL CELLS MODIFIED BY THE RULE INTO NEW STATES ==
;; Proceeding from an initial state allotted to each cell, any of these
;; units develops, in respondency to its neighborhood and the substrate
;; rule, into a new generation, having acquired a modulated state.
;; 
;; == ELEMENTARY CELLULAR AUTOMATON: 1 DIMENSION, 2 BITS, 3 NEIGHBORS ==
;; A polymechany, both for its allicient and its theoretical vallidom,
;; by Stephen Wolfram, the elementary cellular automaton employs a
;; one-dimensional arrangement --- a line --- of cells.
;; 
;; Each such unit's state desumes its diorism from the binary type, that
;; is, an integral value from the range {0, 1}, usually initialized to
;; zero (0) at the process' inchoation.
;; 
;; A cell's neighborhood embraces a very scanty perimeter, considering
;; merely its accolent sinistral peer, and the comperange immediately at
;; its dextral laterality, thus forming a triple of bits.
;; 
;; The most kenspeckle proprium of this automaton species, the rules are
;; encoded in octets, and enumerated by mediation of their decimal
;; integer equivalents, spanning the range [0, 255], and, as a
;; corollary, entailing a cardinality of 256 members. The nomenclature
;; employed in the assignment of the decimal formulation to the 8-bit
;; binary pattern is known as the "Wolfram code". Following this scheme,
;; as an example adduced, the bit pattern "00011110", tantamount to the
;; integral number 30, acquires the name "rule 30".
;; 
;; An elementary cellular automaton rule, nourished with a cell and its
;; neighborhood, produces an aefauld bit, representing the considered
;; cell's new state.
;; 
;; The cell addressed for modification and its neighboring jumelle,
;; demarcated in their states by a bit each, in conjunction form a 3-bit
;; binary sequence, which we may neven the "bit key". Such an intrined
;; base-2 compound naturally corresponds to an integer object in the
;; interval [0, 7].
;; 
;; Accoutred with these parcels of cognescence --- a rule qua an 8-bit
;; pattern, and a cell represented by a triad of itself and the accolent
;; near-dwellers ---, the nexus governing their interplay is rendered
;; conspicable: A rule consists of eight bits, indexed with integers in
;; the range [0, 7]; the 3-bit bit key, begotten by a processed cell's
;; vicinage, siclike reproduces this integral interval, and actually
;; defines an index into the rule, selecting and returning the bit at
;; the respective location. This bit designates the cell's next state.
;;

;; nortelry concerning the elementary cellular automaton's indicia:

;; == APPENDIX B: PROJECT FILES ==
;; The convolute nature encumbering the project's requisita establishes
;; the necessity for its source code's distribution across a rather
;; wide array of files.
;; 
;; The following table applies itself to these components' enumeration,
;; complementing the agnomination and the agency by the concrete order
;; of the file's loading.
;; 
;; Please note that at least one infrastructure of nearly official
;; weight exists for such project management purposes, realized in the
;; definition of file interfaces using packages, and their orders and
;; relationships' enunciation by the "ASDF" system. This simple example,
;; however, has been adjudged as rather inflicted with a digressive
;; cumbrance in an advenient structuring's adhibition, rather than its
;; enjoying  a more serious enterprise certainly would be assayed in an
;; athwart airt.
