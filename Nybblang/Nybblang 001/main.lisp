;; 
;; This program implements an interpreter for the esoteric programming
;; language "Nybblang", invented by the Esolang user
;; "PythonshellDebugwindow" and presented on February 11th, 2020, the
;; commorancy of its kenspeckle proprium maintained in a stack composed
;; of four-bit composites, or nybbles, on which, in the language's
;; standard variation, programs of four bits' capacity, resident in the
;; respective source files, or, in the putatively Turing-complete
;; rendition, an arbitrary binary program, operate.
;; 
;; 
;; Concept
;; =======
;; The Nybblang programming language constitutes a specimen operating
;; on four-bit compounds, or nybbles, by adminiculum of a stack and a
;; buffer whose efficacy applies to an intermediate state betwixt the
;; bits' assemblage into a nybble and the latter's admission to the
;; stack, operated upon by commands encoded in twains of two bits.
;; 
;; == STANDARD NYBBLANG: MANY PROGRAMS IN COMPOUNDS OF FOUR BITS ==
;; A standard Nybblang program's conformation does not apply tolerance
;; to any other content than an exact quadruple tally of binary digits,
;; each jumelle of subsequent symbols coalescing into an aefauld
;; instruction.
;; 
;; A corollary ensuing from this restriction, a separate Nybblang
;; program enumerates exactly two commands, an imposition alleviated by
;; the contingency to request an import of the next program via a
;; dedicated operation.
;; 
;; The standard Nybblang interpreter is expected to accept either an
;; ordered sequence of Nybblang files or a directory comprehend such,
;; their occurrency's embodiment that of a circular list, with an
;; ultimity of the desinent program's import an iterum commencement from
;; the first specified member.
;; 
;; The interpreter invocation's forbisen thus is limned in the
;; following, with the succedaneous segments' demarcation installed in
;; a jumelle of braces ("{...}"):
;; 
;;   nybblang {file-1} {file-2} ... {file-N}
;; 
;; where {file-1} establishes the entry point into the application.
;; 
;; A concrete example illustrates the concept:
;; 
;;   nybblang main.nyb sub1.nyb sub2.nyb
;; 
;; The provision of a directory in the file listing's stead assumes the
;; guise:
;; 
;;   nybblang {directory}
;; 
;; An example adduced:
;; 
;;   nybblang my/directory
;; 
;; == "JUMPING NYBBLANG": GOTO AS AN ATTEMPT AT TURING-COMPLETENESS ==
;; An extended variant of Nybblang, a derivation whose formation targets
;; the desiderated, yet not proven, contingency for Turing-completeness,
;; exists --- here apportioned the agnomination "Jumping Nybblang",
;; educed by its kenspeckle modulation from the original designment.
;; 
;; This language's reliance upon a single program rather than a sequence
;; thereof incorporates as a concomitant the homologation of a
;; bourneless amount of instructions to furnish its constituents, again,
;; of course, expressed as binary symbols.
;; 
;; The now superfluous program import facility transforms through a
;; supersession into a conditional goto mechanism, selecting the next
;; command based upon a one-indexed target designator.
;; 
;; == THE NYBBLANG MEMORY: A NYBBLE-VALUED STACK AND A BUFFER ==
;; An adminicle to the paravaunt memory component, a stack capacitated
;; to maintain nybbles as its elements, an intermediate and provisional
;; storage applies itself to the four requisite bits' collation, ere
;; the compound's patration is conveyed to the stack.
;; 
;; == THE TEMPORARY VARIABLE: A NYBBLE BUFFER FOR THE STACK ==
;; The insertion into the paravaunt memory component, the stack,
;; constitutes in a most abstract application of one's conspectuity,
;; a twiformed process: Imprimis, a four-bit buffer's nurture ought to
;; be driven to surfeiture, ere the thus formed nybble transfers onto
;; the stack top, administering as the obbligatio the epiphenomenon of
;; the buffer's restoration to the inchoate state.
;; 
;; The appertaining principle's notion shall enjoy, for the sake of an
;; enhanced mete of nortelry, the following listing's illustration:
;; 
;;   (0) The temporary variable starts in the decimal state of
;;       zero (0), tantamount to four zero-valued bits, or one
;;       zero-nybble:
;;         0000
;;       For our illustrations, we designate this incomplete, or any
;;       partially defined state, for this matter, by hyphens ("-"), as
;;       a distinguishment betwixt a completed zero-valued variable and
;;       an yet depleted state carries essential ponderance; hence, our
;;       initial variable nybble bears:
;;         ----
;;   
;;   (1) If a "push" instruction is issued, that is, either "00" or
;;       "01", the committed binary digit, zero (0) or one (1), is
;;       transferred into the temporary variable's least significant
;;       position.
;;       Given a digit twain "a" to push, this first behest sets the
;;       initially blank variable nybble
;;         ----
;;       to
;;         ---a
;;   
;;   (2) If a second "push" instruction is imposed, the new binary digit
;;       now occupies the next higher variable location.
;;       As a forbisen, the digit "b" renders the hitherto variable
;;       state
;;         ---a
;;       to
;;         --ba
;;   
;;   (3) The process continues for the next "push", here with a
;;       succedaneum nevened "c", that occupies the next higher bit
;;       position, extending
;;         --ba
;;       to
;;         -cba
;;   
;;   (4) A fourth "push" instruction serves to specify the highest
;;       nybble location. Given the bit "d" to insert, we arrive from
;;         -cba
;;       at the surfeited
;;         dcba
;;   
;;   (5) Immediately ensuing from this act of patration in point (4),
;;       the variable value, now composed of an entire four-bit nybble
;;       datum, is pushed unto the stack of nybbles. As a consequence,
;;       the variable itself is reset to its blank inchoate form
;;         0000
;;       or, as limned by us:
;;         ----
;;       This returns us to the conceptual situation specified in
;;       step (0), as a parasceuastic administration for a contingent
;;       future cycle.
;; 
;; == THE STACK: A THEORETICALLY INFINITE COLLECTION OF NYBBLES ==
;; The stack serves as the ultimate receiver of the respective behest's
;; bits in the form of a nybbles, their introduction, proceeding
;; serelepes until a quadruple whole's edification, consigned to the
;; parhedral nybble buffer's bailiwick.
;; 
;; == NYBBLANG CAN MERELY PRINT 16 DIFFERENT SYMBOLS ==
;; Nybblang's printable alphabet is composed of sixteen (16) symbols,
;; enumerated via a zero-based indexing scheme that, as a corollary,
;; covers the closed integer range [0, 15].
;; 
;; The following table enumerates the symbols in juxtaposition with
;; their locations in the alphabet:
;;

;; Instructions
;; ============
;; The sole criterion of this distinguishment, Nybblang's instruction
;; set bifurcates into the quadruple standard contingency at an
;; equinumerant alternative to the "jumping" variant, the latter of
;; whose divergence reified merely in the "11" command, dedicated, in
;; lieu of the original program import, to a conditional goto facility.

;; 
;; Lacunae in the Specification
;; ============================
;; Maugre the generous mete of lucidity adhibited to its protolog, the
;; Nybblang language's infliction with a few inroads of ambivalency
;; retains is present status. A subset among these lacunae shall be the
;; following sections' cynosure.
;; 
;; == IN WHICH ORDER ARE BUFFERED NYBBLE BITS ASSEMBLED? ==
;; An aspect of conspicuous designment, the Nybblang program memory's
;; componency lays its amplectation around a twissel: a stack that
;; maintains nybbles and a buffer for the assemblage of such four-bit
;; compounds in a stillatim fashion; the latter's efforts contributing
;; the prerequisite to the former's nourishment.
;; 
;; While the necessity of the nybble buffer's patration into a quadruple
;; unity derives in an express manner from the protolog's diction, the
;; mode of the gradual edification, whether siccan pursues an airt from
;; the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant position
;; (MSB), or athwart, eludes an equipollence in lucidity. The lacuna in
;; the specification is compounded by a conflicting account woning in
;; the examples, thilk at one instance adhibits the former, ascending,
;; order, then in other locations apply themselves to the widdershins
;; procession.
;; 
;; It has been adjudged, with lealty to the first unambiguously
;; discernable example, to impute an assemblage of bits in the nybble
;; buffer increasing from the least significant position (LSB) towards
;; the most significant one (MSB), that is, each bit "pushed" onto the
;; same occupies a higher position than its predecessor. This mode, as
;; an interesting concomitant, more closely emulates the stack's last
;; in, first out principle, which, if the bits were pushed immediately
;; instead of consigned to a buffer's provisional castaldy, would
;; construct the received binary digits in such a way as to reverse
;; their admission order.
;; 
;; == DO IMPORTS ABORT THE CURRENT PROGRAM? ==
;; The kenspeckle proprium commorant in the standard Nybblang variation
;; relates to the necessity to concatenate programs, impounded to
;; admit merely an exact account of two instruction each, in order to
;; accompass complex functionality. All examples enjoying their
;; adduction in the protolog ostend the import operation as the desinent
;; among the operative twissel, extending a parasceve to the next
;; actions.
;; 
;; However, the adhibition of the expectancy anent the import as the
;; first instruction member is wanting of a lucid treatise.
;; 
;; Three contingencies' proffer are entalented with tenability:
;; 
;;   (1) The current program is immediately aborted succeeding this
;;       first import instruction's issuance, circumventing the second
;;       member, and, as a corollary, selecting the next program's
;;       inchoate operation.
;;   
;;   (2) The import behest experiences an induction into a temporary
;;       retention, ensuring the second instruction's continuance,
;;       whence ensues the segue into the subsequent program.
;;   
;;   (3) The existency of an import request on the first position
;;       constitutes a subject of interdiction, whose causatum's
;;       embodiment emerges in an abortive error's propagation.
;; 
;; It has been adjudged to comply with the first (1) option, thilk
;; bears both the potential and entelechy of a Procrustean attendance
;; to all instructions as immediately effective warklumes.
;; 
;; 
;; Implementation
;; ==============
;; The interpreter's implementation constitutes an endeavor in the
;; programming language Common Lisp, the Nybblang programs' evaluation
;; being exercised immediately on the code string.
;;
