;; This program implements an interpreter for the esoteric programming
;; language "NeverGonna", invented by the Esolang user "DPS2004" and
;; presented on October 17th, 2019, the abode of its idiopathic element
;; is accommodated by the expression of its programs in an emulation of
;; the lyrics from the song "Never Gonna Give You Up" by Rick Astley.
;; 
;; 
;; Concept
;; =======
;; The NeverGonna programming language ostends the kenspeckle haecceity
;; of its programs' expression by fragmentary excerpts from the song
;; "Never Gonna Give You Up", operating upon a theoretically
;; inenumerable tally of variables whose capacity admits Boolean values,
;; signed integral objects, and strings of any mickleness.
;; 
;; == NEVERGONNA: A TRIBUTE TO PROGRAM IN ==
;; The linguistic specimen's agnomination, as well as its donet, is
;; desumed from the song "Never Gonna Give You Up" by the English
;; musician Rick Astley, dated in its release to July 27th, 1987.
;; 
;; == VARIABLES ENGAGE IN THE DATA CASTALDY ==
;; The aefauld stewardry in reference to the data management is realized
;; in the efforts of the variables, the enumeration of which proceeds in
;; a bourneless fashion by association with an identifier begotten by
;; one's personal deliberations.
;; 
;; All three data types commorant in the NeverGonna language, Boolean
;; truth values, integers, and strings, may be transmitted to and
;; queried from these placeholders.
;; 
;; 
;; Architecture
;; ============
;; NeverGonna's architectural department, as a consectary of its
;; reliance upon variables as the aefauld medium of memorization, levies
;; a scant mete of impositions.
;; 
;; The haecceity appertaining to such identifiers' eath agnomination,
;; admitting preponderantly Latin letters, decimal digits, and the
;; underscore, and its unambiguous association with a value from the
;; realm of Boolean truth values, signed integers, and strings, redes
;; the latreutical involvement of an associative data structure,
;; inclining towards a hashed solution.
;; 
;; 
;; Data Types
;; ==========
;; NeverGonna intrines the basic types of Boolean truth values, signed
;; integers, and strings in its data realm, the first of which serves in
;; it paravaunt appreciation to assay predicate, while the second refers
;; to the arithmetical capacities, concluding with the third species'
;; input/output intercourse.
;; 
;; == BOOLEAN TRUTH VALUES ==
;; The traditional twissel of Boolean truth values, comprised by the
;; affirmative "True" and the negative "False", partakes of the
;; language's potentials, homologating the application of logical
;; warklumes in a program's circumference.
;; 
;; == INTEGER NUMBERS: SIGNED AND UNBOUNDED ==
;; The numeric component answers to signed integers of any magnitude and
;; signum, expressed in the decimal numeral system.
;; 
;; == STRINGS: BOURNELESS CHARACTER SEQUENCES ==
;; An arbitrary tally of character entities, desumed from the ASCII
;; repertoire, may be communicated by any of two connatural
;; significaions: one requiring an ensconcement into double quotation
;; marks ('"'), the other in the singular counterpart ("'").
;; 
;; 
;; Syntax
;; ======
;; NeverGonna's syntactical peculiarities relocate the language to the
;; realm of pseudonatural specimens, composed of lyrical phrases, with
;; each "verse" contributing a single statement's participation.
;; 
;; == INSTRUCTIONS ==
;; The indicial attribute applied to any instruction differs from the
;; concrete instances, but always presents an emulation of natural
;; language.
;; 
;; Arguments as a contingent requisitum are inserted at designated
;; locations, maintaining a lealty to the idiopathic case as much as the
;; syntaxis' exposition.
;; 
;; == ARGUMENTS: INTEGERS, STRINGS, AND VARAIBLES ==
;; The arguments' presence intrines integer and string literals in
;; conjunction with variables.
;; 
;; == INTEGERS ==
;; The expression of integers obeys to the decimal notation.
;; 
;; == STRINGS ==
;; Strings literals may be expressed in one of a twain of slight
;; variations in embracing the either double quotation marks ('"') for
;; their content's delineation, or the single-quoted alternative ("'").
;; 
;; == VARIABLES ==
;; Variable identifiers follow the design of one or or more Latin
;; letters, decimal digits, and underscore ("_") symbols.
;; 
;; == WHITESPACES ==
;; Spaces, a terminology superimposed upon the traditional space and the
;; horizontal tab, except for their dever in the segregation of tokens,
;; proffer warklumes loaned from callotechnics rather than urgencies,
;; and thus homologate their distribution at any spatial and
;; quantitative encheson.
;; 
;; Newlines, on the other hand, are infused with a discriminating onus
;; in their separation of statements; as such, their agency must be
;; encountered with respect, while supererogative instances retain the
;; program's patience.
;; 
;; == COMMENTS ==
;; NeverGonna's provisions includes a single type of comments, such
;; expand across the rest of the line. Proceeding from a sequence of
;; two accolent hyphens, "--", all subsequent content until the next
;; linebreak or the end of the source is construed as an apostille.
;; 
;; Concretely, the following weftage's imposition holds:
;; 
;;   -- COMMENT TEXT
;;      ************
;; 
;; where the {COMMENT TEXT} extends to the commencing line's dextral
;; bourne.
;; 
;; Nesting, as well as premature cessation, eludes this facility's
;; competences.
;; 
;; == GRAMMAR ==
;; A formulation of the language's donet in accordance with the Extended
;; Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) regulations shall be adhibited as a vehicle
;; for a more stringent approach to the construction:

;; Instructions
;; ============
;; NeverGonna's instruction set tallies a septuple cardinality, the

;; iteration.

;; Lacunae in the Specification
;; ============================
;; Maugre the adminicula invested by its treatise and examples, the
;; NeverGonna programming language's original specification tholes some
;; mete of ambiguity, the same tharfs explications. Extricated from this
;; membership, a select parcel shall be administered further attendance.
;; 
;; == HOW SHALL DECLARED BUT UNASSIGNED VARIABLES RESPOND? ==
;; The intermede governing the spatial sepiment betwixt a variable's
;; declaration and its assignment encumbers the language with a further
;; imposition, such as appertains to the subliminal placeholder state
;; in its respondency to indagations and modifications.
;; 
;; If a variable, declared but not yet assigned, is rendered amenable to
;; queries and manipulations, the following potential reactions rede
;; their contemplation:
;; 
;;   (1) An error is issued, apprizing the responsible party about the
;;       kensback circumstance.
;;   
;;   (2) A default value is tacitly affiliated as an epiphenomenon
;;       during the declaration, whence inquisitions are served.
;; 
;; It has been adjudged, proceeding from extant forbisens' adduction in
;; the protolog, to whom the necessity of sane initializations, even for
;; "for" loop counter variables, ostends a requisitum, to regulate the
;; mechanisms in covenableness with the first (1) alternative; in
;; consectary all variable, in the aftermath of their declaration,
;; ought to be explicitly assigned a value ere an indagation.
;; 
;; 
;; Implementation
;; ==============
;; This simple implementation is realized in Common Lisp, employing the
;; parser combinator concept for the assemblage of abstract syntax tree
;; (AST) nodes from tokens; the kenspeckle proprium of this project,
;; however, wones in its conjunction of the parser combinator principle
;; with the top-down precedence technique proposed by Vaughan
;; Pratt,[pratt1973top] begetting a champarty which in the latter case
;; facilitates the involvement of operator precedence handling in
;; expressions.
;; 
;; == PARSERS AND COMBINATORS ARE FUNCTIONS ==
;; In eath diction, the parser combinator approach constructs a complete
;; parser entity from a sequence of interoperating smaller parsers,
;; their coefficiency enabled through combinators.
;; 
;; Both parsers and combinators are, in their pristine diorism,
;; represented by functions, accepting a source to parse and returning
;; in the case of a successful application a composition apprehending at
;; least
;; 
;;   - The remaining portion of the source, curtailed by the consumed
;;     items.
;;     If, for instance, the source represents a string, the first
;;     characters matching the parsing predicate will be removed; for
;;     tokens in lieu of this direct input, the residue following the
;;     accepted token objects are delivered.
;;   - An object designating the parser's or combinator's contribution
;;     to the encompassing whole, that is, usually an AST node.
;; 
;; A failure in the parser's or combinator's operations usually
;; concludes either with a communicative flag or an error signaling.
;; 
;; Conforming to an augmentation in formality, the following signature
;; may be proffered for parsers and combinators:
;; 
;;   function (source : any) -> (newSource : any, output : any)
;; 
;; == PARSERS AND COMBINATORS ARE INTERWOVEN IN SERIES ==
;; Considering the successful case, the modified parser or combinator
;; source is utilized as an input to the subsequent parser/combinator,
;; chaining these into a series of processors that, in concluding in an
;; ultimately empty source, build the output structure, for instance,
;; the abstract syntax tree.
;; 
;; == PARSERS EQUAL COMBINATORS ==
;; The discrepancy betwixt parsers and combinators constitutes a rather
;; puisne question of terminology for most objectives, as both partake
;; of a functional commonality. Parsers are usually "stand-alone"
;; components, responsible for the actual modification of the source,
;; whereas combinators ligate zero or more parsers, or other
;; combinators, in order to accompass a result.
;; 
;; If we have, as an example, a parser "characterOf", defined as
;; 
;;   function characterOf (expectedCharacter : character)
;;     let characterParser <- function (source : string)
;;       if source[0] = expectedCharacter then
;;         return (source.substring (1, source.length),
;;                 makeNode(NODE_TYPE_CHARACTER, source[0])
;;       else
;;         return null
;;       end if
;;     end function
;;     
;;     return characterParser
;;   end function
;; 
;; the requisitum involved in parsing more than one character coerces us
;; to discover a chaining of mandatorily matching "characterOf"
;; invocations. To this end, we define the following combinator:
;; 
;;   function allMatch (parsers : parserFunction[0..*])
;;     let allCombinator <- function (source : string)
;;       let newSource <- source
;;       let nodes     <- empty node list
;;       for every parser currentParser in parsers do
;;         let parserResult <- currentParser(source)
;;         
;;         if parserResult is null then
;;           return null
;;         else
;;           newSource <- parserResult[0]
;;           append parserResult[1] to nodes
;;         end if
;;       end for
;;       
;;       return (newSource, nodes)
;;     end function
;;     
;;     return allCombinator
;;   end function
;; 
;; An exemplary invocation of the combinator "allMatch" with several
;; instances of the "characterOf" parser could involve:
;; 
;;   parse (allMatch (characterOf ('h'),
;;                    characterOf ('e'),
;;                    characterOf ('l'),
;;                    characterOf ('l'),
;;                    characterOf ('o')),
;;          "hello")
;; 
;; == A PARSER COMBINATOR IN AN OBJECT-ORIENTED CONTEXT ==
;; The principal and onomastic substrate derives from Jeffrey Massung's
;; "parse" package for Common Lisp, which please see under
;; [massung2020parse]. A diverging aspect is apportioned its commorancy
;; in the object-oriented variation, substituting the functional notions
;; in order to emphasize the coefficacy partaken of by the several
;; components.

;; reference to such topics that ostend a mete of pertinence
;; intermediate betwixt a vindication of its attendance and a docimasy
;; producing no stringency to incorporate in the primary writ.

;; == APPENDIX B: PROJECT FILES ==
;; A paragon of complex intercourse among components, this project's
;; circumference has been assayed with a supputation that vindicates its
;; concameration into several files, rather than a unity in spatial
;; coherence.
;; 
;; The ensuing conformation will enjoy a cursory, yet hopefully
;; didascalic, species of explication.
;; 
;; Please note that at least one infrastructure of nearly official
;; weight exists for such project management purposes, realized in the
;; definition of file interfaces using packages, and their orders and
;; relationships' enunciation by the "ASDF" system. This simple example,
;; however, has been adjudged as rather inflicted with a digressive
;; cumbrance in an advenient structuring's adhibition, rather than its
;; enjoying  a more serious enterprise certainly would be assayed in an
;; athwart airt.
